**This is the part 2 of [Python Projects first part](https://github.com/Damsith-LK/Udemy-Projects)**


## 🚀 Projects I have completed and days I have finished:

- ### Amazon Price Tracker 💵 (Day 47)
      1. First the program gets the price of the product (The url is given)
      2. Then it checks if that price is smaller than the preferred purchase price in the code
      3. If the above condition is true, then an e-mail would be sent with relevent information

- ### Musical Time Machine 🎵 (Day 46)
      1. This program asks user to enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
      2. Then it searches the top 100 songs at that time
      3. After that, the program gets the URIs for the songs
      4. Afterwards, it creates a spotify playlist (if it the playlist already doesn't exist)
      5. Finally, It adds the songs into the playlist (if the above condition is true)
    
- ### Day 45 (Web scraping with beautifulsoup 🍲)
