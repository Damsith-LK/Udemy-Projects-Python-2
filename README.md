# 💻 About 
**This is the part 2 of [Python Projects first part](https://github.com/Damsith-LK/Udemy-Projects)**


## 🚀 Projects I have completed and days I have finished:

- ### Day 45 (Web scraping with beautifulsoup 🍲)

- ### Musical Time Machine (Day 46)
      1. This program asks user to enter a date in the format YYYY-MM-DD
      2. Then it searches the top 100 songs at that time
      3. After that, the program gets the URIs for the songs
      4. Afterwards, it creates a spotify playlist (if it the playlist already doesn't exist)
      5. Finally, It adds the songs into the playlist (if the above condition is true)
